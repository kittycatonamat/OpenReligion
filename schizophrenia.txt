We are mistaking hearing voices for thinking. People meditate, contemplate or are unconscious/unaware.

This can be tested by making your body relaxed. If you are still hearing voices (thinking) then ask yourself why your mind is not calm when it is part of your body and your body is calm.

Another test is to try interacting with them by talking out loud. This feels like talking to other people. They are likely mistaking what you are saying for their thoughts - keep this in mind and try to be nice to them. They are people like you who are talking to themselves.

Some people locate people who are talking to themselves (talking to the voices they hear) and follow them around or put them under surveillance. Computer devices are often infected with viruses extend their surveillance powers. If you notice inexplicable lag on your phone/tablet/laptop then it is likely infected. Test this by switching on airplane mode. The lag should go away.

When I was sleeping rough I got an Amazon Fire and kept it in my inside coat pocket. This prevented them from accessing it until I left it charging unattended in cafes a few times. Suddenly lag appeared. This happened to my laptop and desktop at home. They gain entry to your home by posing as people you'd be friends with. They drug you/wait for you to fall asleep/etc and have your keys copied or they pick your locks [needs investigation].

Fixing Schizophrenia:
Move to a zero stress environment (night shelters and day centres  in south london are great). Take anti-inflammatories (e.g. ibuprofen) until your skin tone is normal and veins become visible. Take anti-convulsants (taurine in energy drinks will do) if your eyes won't stay still (if you can feel them shaking when you close them and try to relax). Talk about what you've been through with someone - you probably have PTSD or CPTSD (Complex PTSD) which needs to be healed to get back to normal. Your baseline stress level is high which is why the voices and tinnitus sound so loud. Reducing stress and managing the inflammation caused by them being so loud will lead to the voices and high pitch sound becoming quiet then unnoticable again. You have been hearing them your whole life, you just didn't notice.
