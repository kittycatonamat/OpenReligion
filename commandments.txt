Do not fall into chronic stress/chronic inflammation/addiction.
Everything you do must benefit you, your social group and humanity as a whole.
Do not think; contemplate (meditate or non-think on a subject) instead.

Recovery mode:
No sex/masturbation.
Do not indulge any thoughts.
Do not have any conversations.
Live without money.
Do not get intoxicated.
Have no obligations.
Do lots of light aerobic exercise.

tl;dr - do not get excited or stressed and walk a lot.

technical version:
Avoid inflammation [and stress?] ]at all costs to prevent chronic inflammation from forming. Wait until everything [what things?] normalise. The test for a done condition is when you feel good [or great?] under the recovery mode constraints.

tl;dr - avoid inflammation until the body recovers.
