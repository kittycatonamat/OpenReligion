Goals
---------

Its core goal is to reduce stress/inflammation to foster unity among people by lowering their defenses and encouraging them to have more positive interactions and to cooperate with each other more. 

Stress and inflammation
----------

The reason we fight is that we get too stressed out, don't listen to each other, lose our tempers and end up lashing out at one another. This traumatises us, creating yet more stress. 

We end up with addictions because of this stress, whether to money which causes the wealth inequality gap to grow; to drugs which causes families to break apart, traumatising its members and creating yet more stress and addiction; to gambling, resulting in poverty and yet more stress; to violence and abuse, resulting in more trauma; or to sex, resulting in social isolation and stress [citations needed].

Both excitement and stress cause inflammation which makes dopamine more tasty to our brains [citation needed]. This is where impulsive behaviour originates. If our environment is stressful then we can fall into a state of chronic stress/inflammation and addiction [citation needed].
