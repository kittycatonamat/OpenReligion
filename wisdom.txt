Invalidation causes personality defects.

Thinking about what problem to solve is the first problem you should solve after learning to think correctly.
Sharp emotional state changes are stressful and/or inflammatory. Be careful about how you interact with others. You can turn them into an addict if you're careless.

Facitators, leaders, managers, followers. The four designations of social power.

Information systems and human experience are similar. You get zen memes in hacker communities and zen IRL. Not experiencing something, experiencing something for the first time and subsequent experiences are distinct; zero, one or infinity is a concept in IT.

The former happens in a unit of time, the latter over a series of unit times. Time that we percieve is therefore actually space.
In one unit of time, all laws change. In the second unit, all laws change, excluding itself. In the third unit, all laws change, excluding itself. ... In the nth unit, all laws change, excluding itself.
There are therefore three classes of things in the universe.
There is self similarity between n=[0 .. 1] and n=[2 .. infinity]

Due to self similarity, everything is knowable. Due to the butterfly effect, everything is only knowable if you know yourself since there will be error when measuring anything that is not yourself. You are nothing. If you know nothing then you know yourself and can know anything.

Attachment is conditioning facilitated by (chronic) inflammation.

It is bad when two things become one (dependencies); it is good when two concepts become one (abstraction).

The mind meditating is the object, the thing being meditated on only exists in one's perception, making it a subject, and the awareness of all of this is also not a thing, it is you- a subject. The subject that is you also only exists in your perception, like the subject of meditation.
